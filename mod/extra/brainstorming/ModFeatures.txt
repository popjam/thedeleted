  + Hazardberry Hills
    Golf world: Golf ball spawns on one empty, accessible grid location. The 'cup' spawns
    somewhere else on the map. One golf ball per player. Enemies cannot push ball once stationary,
    but once in motion can move it / hit them. Each room will have a randomly generated 'par'.
    And your total score will be totalled for the floor. Every players pocket item swaps out for the
    'golf club' item, a timed rechargeable item which when used, fires your ball. You can
    hold down this item for more power, and you must be next to your ball to fire it. If a room
    finishes before the players have finished putting, golf balls/cups disappear and the score is
    disqualified (unless player has hit the ball, then it is )

    At the end of the floor, the total is added up:

    -5 points: 2 golf items.
    -4 points: 1 golf item.
    -3 points: 10 pickups.
    -2 points: 3 pickups.
    -1 point: 1 pickup.
    0 points: Nothing.

    is a new group of enemies. Sometimes they are both completely different.
    Player chooses which ones they want to face. Enemies are then placed back.
    A 'train' animation runs over the group you didn't choose, 'killing' them.
    In boss rooms, the original boss + another similar boss are suggested. Same for mini-boss rooms.

  + Pica Paradise
